# Abstract.

This paper presents a method for the detection of animated
scenes in movie trailers. Regardless of the studio, artists, and the unique
features of diverse animation creation techniques, machine learning tools
can provide a concise detection methods of animated scenes in movie
components. A dataset is prepared by selecting scenes from trailers us-
ing shot boundary analysis and removal of scenes containing non-movie
contents; e.g. credentials. The dataset is composed of over 1400 movie
scenes from 230 trailers of various genre. A Convolutional Neural Net-
work (CNN) architecture followed by Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is
built by using transfer learning of EfficientNet.
